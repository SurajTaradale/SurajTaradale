<h3>Who Am I</h3>
<span>Suraj Taradale</span><br>
<p>Hello there! I'm a full stack developer with expertise in a range of programming languages and technologies, including Perl, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, ReactJS, MySQL, and Android application development. I have also worked with the OTRS framework, specializing in customizations for incident management, service requests, change management, surveys, and asset management.
</p>
<p>I am passionate about using technology to solve complex problems and enjoy collaborating with others to create innovative solutions. I am skilled in both front-end and back-end development, and I am always looking for new and better ways to approach programming challenges.</p>

<p>As a lifelong learner, I am committed to continuously improving my skills and knowledge. I am also passionate about sharing my knowledge with others and helping them achieve their own goals. That's why I enjoy writing technical articles on Medium, where I can share my insights and help others in the developer community.</p>

<p>When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the great outdoors, playing music, or spending time with family and friends. I believe in living a well-rounded life, and I think that balance is essential for success in any field.</p>
